# Image Classification Using Machine learning

## Idea Behind This.
Imagine you research or development is related to images and you deal with thousands of different images every day. how would you differentiate between different types of images?
I used the simple image classification approach on Galaxy classification. Used different sources to collect around 50000 images of un sorted galaxies, fed it to custome model of 
tensor to find difference between them and sort them in different folders.
